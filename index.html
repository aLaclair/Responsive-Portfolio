                <p id="bio" style="margin-top:21px">Hello! Welcome to my first real web development project ever! My name is Austin LaClair and I am currently a student learning Web Development through UCF’s coding bootcamp. 
                    I am searching for a career in this field not only to have a career, but because this is what I am truly passionate about. I wanted something that could combine two aspects in my life that I love but I felt were underrepresented; Technology and Creativity. 
                    I have always been very interested in how the tech-heavy world around me works and always was researching new technologies, but never immersing myself in these techs. I also have always thought of myself as a creative person, but felt I never had an outlet to portray my thoughts (basically I am good at creating ideas but not very good at drawing, painting, singing, film, etc.) 
                    4 years of JROTC in high school which led me to my greatest accomplishment of my lifetime, climbing the ranks until I became one of the 4 top officers in the program who commanded the unit. Through the 4 years of JROTC, I learned a lot of valuable life skills that I felt traditional classes did not or could not teach me. 
                    I learned how to interview better, I learned what self-discipline meant, even the small things down to making sure your gig line was aligned allow me to dress more professionally with a more cohesive look. 
                </p>

                <p>I am currently a student and devoting most of my time learning new skills as I hope I will do for the rest of my life, however I am up to a challenge to further my understanding of web development. 
                    Feel free to contact me on my contact page. Thanks!
